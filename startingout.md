# Getting Started

## Choosing A Recording Software
* For simplicity's sake, we will be using the Xbox gamebar that comes standard on Windows 10.
* There are other methods of screen recording available, but the availability and ease of use make Xbox gamebar an easy choice.

1. In the bottom left corner, search Xbox gamebar and open it up.
2. You should see a window pop up that says capture.
3. Find a program or software you'd like to record and pull it up.


## Things to Look Out For
* Xbox gamebar will not record your computers desktop.
* You must have a program up and running to be able to initiate the screen capture button.
